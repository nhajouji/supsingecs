# Supersingular Elliptic Curves and Isogeny Graphs 

This repository contains various tools for studying supersingular elliptic
curves and supersingular isogeny graphs.


## Requirements

The current version of the code is written in Python, and requires Pandas to run.

## Overview
The code can be used to compute the following:

*   The set of supersingular j-invariants for all primes p
*   The supersingular isogeny graph for all pairs p, l where l is a supersingular prime.
*   The trace of the adjacency matrix of the supersingular isogeny graph for all pairs of primes p, l.

## Theory
The algorithms are based on the results in:
